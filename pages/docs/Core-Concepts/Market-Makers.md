# Market Makers

## Conceptual
A **Market Maker** is a firm or individual that actively quotes two sided markets in a particular `ASSET`. They provide bids and asks (buy and sell orders) along with the size of each. These market makers provide liquidity and make a profit from the difference in the bid-ask spread. Irrespective of market conditions and volatility, market makers must remain disciplined in order to continue facilitating liquidity for traders. 

The service they provide is integral to smooth order flow for traders. If market makers were not bound to supplying liquidity to both sides of the order book, then traders may have a harder time entering and exiting out of positions, especially when the market starts to move. 

Let's briefly dive into the `bid-ask spread` to see how market makers actually make money for providing this crucial service. 

Say the best bid for BTC is $20,000 and the best ask is $20,005. The spread is rather tight at $5. This means that the market maker will purchase 1 BTC for $20,000 and will sell 1 BTC for $20,005, netting $5 in profit. We all know that the price of BTC can be very volatile and $5 might not seem like a lot of revenue for holding such a volatile asset, but high volume trading can add up to large profits over time. 

This example further illustrates the importance of market makers to efficient markets. If the exchange did not have market makers it would be relying on the individual traders limit orders to add liquidity to the order book and this would certainly lead to lower levels of liquidity and a much larger spread -> which would lead to less traders using the exchange -> which would lead to even lower liquidity and larger spreads. 

The opposite is certainly true, the more market makers in a particular market -> leads to more liquidity -> which leads to tighter spreads -> which leads to better prices and liquidity for traders to enter and exit positions. 

Market makers are the cornerstone of an efficient market.
